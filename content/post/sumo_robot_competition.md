**Event Summary**

Two robots compete in an autonomous (no human operator) head-to-head match following the basic system of traditional sumo robot matches. Robots are allowed no weapons. The sole purpose is a "pushing match" between the two robots to force one another from the arena.

## **Section 3: Requirements for Robots**

### **Article 5 (Robot Specifications)**

1. A robot must fit within a square tube of the appropriate dimensions. A robot may expand in size after a match begins, but must not physically separate into pieces, and must remain a single centralized robot. Robots violating these restrictions shall lose the match. Screws, nuts, and other robot parts with a total mass of less than 5 grams falling off from a robot's body shall not cause the loss of match.

2. The total mass of a robot at the start of a match must be under the designated weight for the given class.

| Specification | Value |
|---|---|
| Length    | 20cm          |
| Width     | 20cm          |
| Height    | No Boundary   |
| Weight    | 3000g         |


3. **Autonomous:** Robots must be autonomous. Any method of control may be used, as long as it is fully contained within the robot and receives no external signals or directions (human, machine, or otherwise). Autonomous robot operation must begin automatically no less than five seconds after being started by the user. Robots starting before the five second mark forfeit the match.

4. The robot must have a name or number for registration purposes. Display this name or number on your robot to allow spectators and officials to identify your robot.

### **Article 6 (Robot Restrictions)**

2. Parts that could break or damage the ring are not allowed. Do not use parts that are intended to damage the opponent’s robot or it's operator. Normal pushes and bangs are not considered intent to damage.


3. Devices that can store liquid, powder, gas or other substances for throwing at the opponent are not allowed.


4. Any flaming devices are not allowed.


5. Devices that throw things at your opponent are not allowed.


6. Sticky substances to improve traction are not allowed. Tires and other components of the robot in contact with the ring must not be able to pick up and hold a standard 3"x5" index card for more than two seconds.


7. Devices to increase down force, such as a vacuum pump or magnets, are not allowed.


8. All edges, including but not limited to the front scoop, must not be sharp enough to scratch or damage the ring, other robots, or players.

## **Section 5: Starting, Stoping, Resuming, and Ending a Match**

### **Article 8 (Start)**

Upon the judge's instructions, the two teams bow to each other in the outer ring, approach the ring, and place a robot within their half of the ring on or behind the line. (A robot or a part of a robot may not be placed beyond the front edge of the line toward the opponent. Note that is not required that a robot be placed directly behind the line; it may be offset to the side, as long as it is behind an imaginary line collinear with the line. When the judge announces the start of the round, the teams start their robots, and after a five second pause the robots may start operating. During these five seconds, players must clear out of the ring area.

### **Article 9 (Stop/Resume)**

The match stops and resumes when a judge announces so.
### **Article 10 (End)**

## **Section 7: To Win**

1. A team forces the body of the opposing robot outside the ring

2. The match shall be stopped and a rematch started under the following conditions:
   
   1. The robots are entangled or orbiting each other with no perceivable progress for five seconds. If it is unclear whether progress is being made or not, the judge can extend the time limit for observable progress for up to 30 seconds.
   
   2. Both robots move, without making progress, or stop (at the exact same time) and stay stopped for five seconds without touching each other. However, if one robot stops it's movement first, after five seconds it will be declared as not having the will to fight. In this case the opponent shall receive the win for that round, even if the opponent also stops. If both robots are moving and it isn't clear if progress is being made or not, the judge can extend the time limit up to 30 seconds.
